# Description

The project uses Python to scrape wage data from [Job Bank](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/home), to perform simple data analysis and to generate Excel and PDF reports. The data are drawn from the Canadian national job board, which has a huge number of job postings classified by the Canadian National Occupation Classification (NOC) and other related data.

# Installation

## Tools

- Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  - You can [download the famous text editor Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).
  - Or, you can [download the popular IDE Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- Python 3
  - You can [install Python 3 from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Python Package Installer/Manager `pip`
  - If you installed Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/), you should already have `pip`. If it is not installed, you can use the command `py -m ensurepip --default-pip` to bootstrap it from the standard library. If you are using Linux, you will have to [install the package manager separately](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/). You can find out more about the `pip` tool [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/).
- Command-line interface (CLI)
  - You can [install the open-source PowerShell on Windows, Linux and macOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) if you do not have or want to use a pre-installed CLI on your local machine.

## How-to

Check if you have Python installed using the command `python --version`, or simply, `python version`, in the CLI. [Git-clone the project repository from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to the local machine. Use the command `py -m pip install package_name` to install the necessary Python libraries. Check out [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/) to learn more about `pip install`. Check the top part of the `.py` script file for the list of libraries required. For example, you may need `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries if you see the following lines in the top part of the script file:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

If `pip` fails to locate the relevant packages, you may find it at [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/). Use `python file_name.py` to run the script in a CLI. Or, use an IDE, such as VS Code, to run the script. There will usually be a [Run] button in the top right corner of the opened script file.
