# freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification

Certification: [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python)

## Certification Description

Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. By the end of this certification, you'll know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.

## Course List

1. Data Analysis with Python
2. Numpy
3. Data Analysis with Python Projects

## Repository Description

This repository contains code from reading or video tutorial format discussed in the lessons or courses in this certification. Some instructors may provide their source code files hosted on GitHub or links to download the source code from the course website directly. However, it is usually scattered all over the courses. Therefore, it has been recompised in the general order presented in the course but with some additional materials and explanations.
